# Zeotap Data Science Assignment
This repository contains the solution for the Zeotap Data Science Assignment. The task involves exploratory data analysis (EDA), building a lookalike model, and performing customer segmentation/clustering using the provided eCommerce transaction dataset.

# Tasks Overview
1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Dataset exploration to understand the structure and key attributes.
Data preprocessing to handle missing values and format inconsistencies.
Visualizations to gain insights into trends, patterns, and relationships:
Total transactions by region.
Monthly sales trends.
Correlation heatmap of important metrics.
2. Lookalike Model
Built a predictive model to identify customers similar to the target audience.
Utilized supervised learning techniques and evaluated model performance.
3. Customer Segmentation (Clustering)
Performed customer segmentation using the K-Means clustering algorithm.
Standardized customer transaction data for optimal results.
Evaluated clusters using the Davies-Bouldin Index.

# Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python
Libraries:
Pandas, NumPy
Matplotlib, Seaborn
Scikit-learn

# Results Summary
EDA Insights:
Top-performing regions and product categories were identified.
Monthly sales trends showed peak periods for transactions.
Strong correlation between price and total value, with actionable insights derived.
Lookalike Model:
Predicts potential customers who share similar traits with high-value customers.
Output saved as FirstName_LastName_Lookalike.csv.
Clustering Results:
Number of Clusters: 5
Clusters visualized based on transaction behavior (spending and quantity).
